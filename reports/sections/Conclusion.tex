\section{Conclusion}
An existing SIFT implementation can be recompiled with a compiler that can take advantage of our custom ISA. This eases the burden on software developers. This hardware accelerated design should provide a significant improvement in image throughput for a security system. Also, it leaves the majority of the general purpose processing in the system available for more advanced functions, such as facial and object recognition. An extension of this system would be to have several CPUs with CMs and the special caches to process several frames in parallel. This would bring us closer to achieving near real time performance.
