\section{Introduction}
The goal of this design project is to propose a method of improving the performance of existing SIFT implementations. This enhancement is provided in two forms, the introduction of a new ISA-level instruction and the addition of a specialized coprocessor and cache. Specifically, we will allow the most common and processor-intensive pieces of SIFT to be implemented using these specialized structures, rather than relying on a general purpose processor.
